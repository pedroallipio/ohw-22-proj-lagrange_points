# Project Lagrange Points 

## Simulation lagrangian dispersion in 3 transects of south region of Brazil using numerical model during winter and summer

## Collaborators
- Camila Andreussi @camilakneubl
- Mariana Zorzo @MarianaVZorzo
- Pedro @pedroallipio

## Background
Release of 100 particles on south coast of Brazil, including states of Parana, Santa Catarina and Rio Grande do Sul
3 points in 3 transects will simulate winter and summer
The 3 transects are Lagoa dos Patos, Lagoa do Imaruí and Rio São Francisco do Sul

## Limitations

Doesn't have data to regions close to the coast

## HYCOM

Water Speed
